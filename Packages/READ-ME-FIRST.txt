INSTALLATION
------------
Just drag and drop "advanced-vfr-map" folder to your community folder.

Note for fsBlackBox users: you don't need to launch fsBlackBox to see your plane on map.

IMPORTANT
---------

If you don't want to appear with a random name on the map, click the user icon on the top
right within the panel and set your username.

We highly recommend to enter you username while the panel is not docked to the game to avoid
keys shortcuts to interfere with your key stroke.

Note: avoid special chars and do note use more the 12 chars lenght.
